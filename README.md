Abstract

This article explores the application of Neural Networks (NNs) and Physics-
Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). Two PDEs, the Heat Equation and Burgerâ€™s Equation, are consid-
ered. Through contour plots and results analysis, the superiority of PINNs
over traditional NNs is demonstrate
